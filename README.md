##Log:

##### Day 0: January 21, 2017
1) **1_solveMeFirst:** adding two integers

2) **2_simpleArraySum:** finding the sum of all the contents in an array

##### Day 1: January 22, 2017
1) **3_compareTheTriplets:** creating an array of values representing two scores, each score having three attributing values which are calculated to see which score is greater

2) **4_aVeryBigSum:** finding the sum of long numbers in an array

##### Day 2: January 23, 2017
1) **5_diagonalDifference:** in a 2D, find the absolute difference between the two diagonal lines of integers

2) **6_plusMinus:** an array of random positive and negative integers, and zeros are generated; of the integers in the array you must calculate the percent of positive, negative, and zero integers

##### Day 4: January 25, 2017
1) **9_circularArrayRotation:** take in an array of numbers, and shift all of the numbers to a specified index

2) **10_miniMaxSum:** take in five integers, find the sum, and then subtract the min/max sum of four of the numbers from the sum
