# 100 days of Algorithm Challenge

##Log:

#### Day 0: January 21, 2017
1) [**1_solveMeFirst:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/1_solveMeFirst.java) adding two integers

2) [**2_simpleArraySum:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/2_simpleArraySum.java) finding the sum of all the contents in an array

#### Day 1: January 22, 2017
1) [**3_compareTheTriplets:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/3_compareTheTriplets.java) creating an array of values representing two scores, each score having three attributing values which are calculated to see which score is greater

2) [**4_aVeryBigSum:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/4_aVeryBigSum.java) finding the sum of long numbers in an array

#### Day 2: January 23, 2017
1) [**5_diagonalDifference:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/5_diagonalDifference.java) in a 2D, find the absolute difference between the two diagonal lines of integers

2) [**6_plusMinus:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/6_plusMinus.java) an array of random positive and negative integers, and zeros are generated; of the integers in the array you must calculate the percent of positive, negative, and zero integers

#### Day 3: January 24, 2017
1) [**7_staircase:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/7_staircase.java) take in an int, and create print a stair with the specified amount of stairs relative to the int

2) [**8_timeConversion:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/8_timeConversion.java) take in a 12-hour time, separate the each portion of the time, and convert it to a 24-hour time

#### Day 4: January 25, 2017
1) [**9_circularArrayRotation:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/9_circularArrayRotation.java) take in an array of numbers, and shift all of the numbers to a specified index

2) [**10_miniMaxSum:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/10_miniMaxSum.java) take in five integers, find the sum, and then subtract the min/max sum of four of the numbers from the sum

#### Day 5: January 26, 2017
1) [**11_designerPDFViewer:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/11_designerPDFViewer.java) find the area of a word in as if in a PDF by calculating the fixed width by the maximum height of all the letters within the word

2) [**12_kangaroo:**](https://github.com/Lukeskins/100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge/blob/master/Algorithms/12_kangaroo.java) two separate kangaroos are hopping, both starting at a different point, with a different rate; find if the kangaroos ever will jump at the same place
